# XTX-Challenge
2019 XTX Data Science Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create a program to predict stock movement based on real-market orderbook data.

The algorithms I have chosen to implement are...

A small sample of the dataset is included in this starter kit. The full dataset data-training.csv can be downloaded from https://challenge.xtxmarkets.com/ under the Data Download section.

Due to running on a MacBook Air, the decision has been made
to stream the data, change from Data format from csv to binary GRIB, and to run on smaller samples.

The theory work this project implements can be found here: https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/TR2013-953.pdf
